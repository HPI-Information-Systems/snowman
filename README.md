Comparing data matching algorithms is still an unsolved topic in both industry and research.
With snowman, developers and researchers are able to compare the performance of different data matching solutions or improve new algorithms.
Besides traditional metrics, the tool also considers economic aspects like Soft KPIs.

_This tool is developed as part of a bachelor's project in collaboration with SAP SE._

## Current state

In Q1 and Q2 of 2021, we aim to reach the following milestones:

[x] **Milestone 1:** Ability to add/delete datasets, experiments and matching solutions; binary comparison and basic behavior analysis; executable on all major platform  
[x] **Milestone 2:** Compare more than two experiments and create new experiments based on results; survey Soft KPIs, allow comparison based on KPIs  
[x] **Milestone 3:** Allow individual thresholds for experiments, extend Soft KPIs further and allow advanced evaluation of matching solutions

The precise progress is tracked through Github issues and project boards. Please get in touch in case you want a special feature included :)

_After reaching milestone 3, we plan to continue to work on further features which will broaden the tools abilities and features._

## Contributing
