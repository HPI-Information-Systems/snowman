<h1 align="center">Welcome to Snowman</h1>

Have you ever gotten a newsletter twice? Probably - finding duplicates in data is a pretty difficult problem. Many
different matching solutions exist with different approaches and tradeoffs. However, not only finding duplicates is difficult
but also finding a deduplication solution for a dataset or even just comparing two different deduplication solutions.
With our benchmark, we aim to solve exactly this challenge.

_Snowman is developed as part of a bachelor's project in collaboration with SAP SE._
