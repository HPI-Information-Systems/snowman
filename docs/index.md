Have you ever gotten a newsletter twice? Probably - finding duplicates in data is a pretty difficult problem. Many
different algorithms exist with different approaches and tradeoffs. However, not only finding duplicates is difficult
but also finding a deduplication algorithm for a dataset or even just comparing two different deduplication solutions.
With our benchmark, we aim to solve exactly this challenge.

_This tool is developed as part of a bachelor's project in collaboration with SAP SE._

## Basic usage

If you want to use our benchmark as a normal user, please consult the section `Basic usage` for details.

## Development setup

If you intend to contribute to our project, please take a look at the `Development setup` section. It includes some
basic information how to get started.
