# ACM SIGMOD 2021

Welcome participants of the [ACM SIGMOD 2021 programming contest](https://dbgroup.ing.unimore.it/sigmod21contest/)! This page contains some special information for you to get
started more easily with our tool.

Feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/HPI-Information-Systems/snowman/issues/new/choose) in case you find a bug or see space for improvement :)

## Introduction

This tool will help you to compare and evaluate your data matching solutions. You can upload experiment results from your data matching solution and then compare it with a goldstandard, compare two experiment runs with each other or calculate binary metrics like the precision or recall.

## Setup

To use snowman you have to download the latest [release](https://github.com/HPI-Information-Systems/snowman/releases) of snowman for your specific os. After that you are able to start snowman! You can click [here](https://hpi-information-systems.github.io/snowman/basic_usage/workflow/) for a guide of the default workflow of snowman. 
We already integrated the ```Computers```-dataset with a goldstandard of the SIGMOD-contest. Select it, upload your own experiment result and start benchmarking!

## Datasets

We've included an automatic importer for the gold standard format and validated that the below datasets can be imported
out of the box. More datasets will be added as soon as they were released by the contest team.

1. **Computers**: prepackaged dataset X1 and gold standard Y1
