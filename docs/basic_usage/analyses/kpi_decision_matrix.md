## Getting Started

1. [Add all matching solutions you want to compare to Snowman](../matching_solutions.md#adding-a-matching-solution)
2. If you have experiments of the matching solution for datasets with a gold standard [add them to Snowman](../experiments.md#adding-an-experiment)
3. Open the [Benchmark Dashboard](../configuring_analyses.md#benchmark-dashboard) and select the analysis *KPI Decision Matrix*.
4. [Select your matching solutions and experiments in the configurator](../configuring_analyses.md#Configurator)

## Interpreting the Results

| Matching Solution Type   | The architectural type of the matching solution, such as "Machine Learning", "rule-based" or "Active Learning"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Use Case                 | Which use cases does the matching solution cover (e.g., merging from two file, deduplicating one file, ...)? Some matching solutions do not support every use case.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| General Costs            | These include the cost to buy a matchingsolution, the cost to host the infrastructure, etc.. Since thesecan vary from payment model to payment model (one-timecosts, monthly costs, pay-per-use), they are aggregated overthe entire product lifecycle to increase comparability. Sincethese can vary from payment model to payment model (one-time costs, monthly costs, pay-per-use), they are aggregatedover the entire product lifecycle to increase comparability.                                                                                                                                 |
| Deployment Type          | This describes in which way the matching solution has to be deployed: Does a hosted instance exist already? Or is it just locally executable? Hosted instances,for example, often require less maintenance and might be therefore a decision criteria.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Installation Effort      | Embedding a matching solution in the software landscape of a company requires a specific knowledge level and amount of time which varies for each matching solution. The integration effort is split into these kpis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Matching Solution Effort | Another task is configuring the matching solution itself. Some matching solutions do not require any specific knowledge (for example, solutions where uploading only a file is sufficient), but other matching solution need detailed configurations. Because of that, we propose to measure the effort to configure a matching solution by knowledge-level and HR-Amount.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Domain Effort            | Matching solutions often require domain knowledge during the configuration phase: A machine learning based approach, for example, needs pre-labeled data to fit the model. For that, a person who knows the domain has to classify given pairs of records, in order to create a trainings dataset. For rule-based approaches domain knowledge is needed, too: Rules have to be created, based on pair-wise similarities. To define effective rules, it requires domain knowledge. This results in a domain effort for the specific matching solution, measured by the required expertise and HR-Amount. |
| Interfaces               | This describes the provided interfaces to access the matching solution (e.g.: GUI, API, CLI). Depending on the use case it might be necessary that the matching solution provides a specific interface: For example, the automation of specific data matching tasks requires an API or CLI.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Supported OS             | On which operating systems is it possible to execute the data matching solution?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

!!! info
    **knowledge-level** and **hr-Amount** are mutually dependent. A person with a higher knowledge-level does usually need less time to configure a specific matching solution. To reflect this issue, we provide an aggregated measure. This is calculated with the [manhattan-distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry) between the **knowledge-level** and the **hr-Amount**
