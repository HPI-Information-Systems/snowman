# Datasets

Each workflow occurs upon a single dataset. As a first step, you'll have to specify a dataset.

## Add a dataset

1. Open page "Datasets" from the sidebar on the left.
2. Add a new dataset with the "+" button in the lower left corner of the screen.
3. Specify a short identifying name and a comprehensive description.
4. If you do not want to upload the complete dataset, select "Skeleton only" as contents and specify the total amount of tuples by hand. This is important to be able to still calculate metrics.
5. If you want to upload the dataset, select "Full upload" as contents, specify the csv parameters and select a file to upload.
6. Click on "Add dataset" - this process may take several minutes to complete as indexes have to be created!

## Edit a dataset

After the initial dataset creation, you can still change some attributes of the dataset. Additionally, you are able to
replace the uploaded file's content.

## Preview a dataset

Once records were uploaded, you can preview the records in the internal Snowman format.
