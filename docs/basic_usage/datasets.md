# Datasets

At the end of this tutorial you will know why and how to add your datasets to Snowman. Additionally you will know what you can do with datasets once they are in the tool.

## Adding a dataset

To add and analyse an experiment inside Snowman, you first have to add the dataset which should be deduplicated.

1. Open the *Datasets* tab.
   - ![Datasets Tab](../assets/datasets-tab.png)
2. Click on the *+* button in the lower left corner of the screen.
   - ![Add Dataset](../assets/add-dataset.png)
3. Give the dataset a short name and optionally a comprehensive description. You can also add tags to the dataset at the bottom of the dialog.
4. Select a CSV file containing the dataset and specify the CSV parameters.
   - The ID column contains a unique alphanumeric identifier for every record.

5. If you do not have access to the dataset records, select *Record count only* as contents and specify the total amount of records in the dataset.
6. Click on *Add* to add the dataset to Snowman.
   - this process can take several minutes depending on the size of the dataset.
7. You should now see your dataset in the Datasets tab
