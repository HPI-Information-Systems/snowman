# Matching Solutions

As a first step, a new user should register matching solutions with the tool, since it is compulsory for an experiment
to be associated with a matching solution.

## Add a solution

1. Open page "Matching solutions" from the sidebar on the left.

2. Add a new solution with the "+" button in the lower left corner of the screen.

3. Specify a short name (without spaces if possible) and a comprehensive description.

## Delete a solution

If a solution was created by accident or is not required anymore, you can delete it. Keep in mind that you'll have to
**delete all associated experiments first!**

## Example

Imagine you are running the Magellan data matching tool (open-source). It allows you to configure several aspects of how
it operates and thereby a lot of customization is possible.

For this use case, you'd only create one matching solution "Magellan" within the tool (use a general description, e.g. ML-based open-source approach). For each configuration, you can
afterwards create a new experiment containing information on the configuration within its description.
