# Improving Matching Solutions

Snowman provides multiple analysis tools which aim to help developers improving their matching solutions.
They can also be used to ease the configuration process necessary to set up a matching solution for a specific use case.
Keep in mind that most of these analyses require a gold standard.

| [Binary Metrics View](../analyses/binary_metrics_view.md)     | The *Binary Metrics View* allows you to explore how good an experiment performed by showing it's predictions and performance metrics. | ![Binary Metrics View](../../assets/benchmark-binary-metrics.png)            |
| [N-Intersection Viewer](../analyses/n_intersection_viewer.md) | The *N-Intersection Viewer* allows you to investigate which duplicates have (not) been detected by which matching solution.           | ![N-Intersecetion Viewer](../../assets/benchmark-intersection.png)           |
| [N-Metrics Table](../analyses/n_metrics_table.md)             | The *N-Metrics Table* allows you to compare performance metrics of multiple experiments.                                              | ![N-Metrics Table](../../assets/benchmark-nmetrics.png)                      |
