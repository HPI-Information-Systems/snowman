# Comparing Matching Solutions

Comparing matching solutions and selecting the best one for a specific use case is a difficult task. Many different factors influence the decision. Mainly they can be grouped by the following:

1. **The general performance** of a matching solution, measured with metrics, such as *precision* or *recall*
2. **The effort to configure a matching solution**, measured with metrics, such as the *time to configure* or *total cost of ownership*

Snowman provides two different analysis tools designed for specifically this use case:
